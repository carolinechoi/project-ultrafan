## On Being a Harry Potter Fan... âš¡ðŸ“š
As showcased by my Harry Potter geo-clock, I really do love Harry Potter. (Don't read this as support for JK Rowling herself.) For my APCS final project, I coded a machine learning system that took Harry Potter text and generated fanfiction. 

It's still a work in progress. I still want to add an option to code in your own name and insert it into the text. I also need to train it for longer and figure out a way that I can do so without it taking hours on end to perfect. 

At its core, this project is a text generator but Harry Potter themed.
